/*
A type is represented as a string of simple
elements called "tq"s (short for "type quanta"). 
There are four basic types of tqs:

Builtin types or USER_TYPE:
    This stores a bitmask of qualifiers, i.e. static, 
    extern, register, auto, const, or volatile.
    
POINTER:
    In the string, a POINTER tq followed by another tq
    containing type x means "pointer-to-x". The tq also
    keeps track of qualifiers for the pointer itself.

ARRAY:
    In the string, an ARRAY tq followed by another tq
    containing type x means "array-of-x". The tq also
    keeps track of the length of the array.

FUNCTION:
    This tq indicates how many arguments the function
    has. The following items in the string of tqs are,
    in this order, all parameters (if any) then the 
    return type.

//I always end up with a dilemma when I have to manage
//arbitrary-length strings. There are three main techniques
//for memory management:
// 1. Pre-allocate a fixed-size array that is "bigger than
//    the longest possible string".
// 1. (variation) Add bounds-checking so that we throw an
//    error instead of overflowing (like the famous gets() worm)
// 2. Use a heap-allocated array that we automatically
//    realloc when we're out of space (Ã  la std::vector).
// 3. Custom pool allocator.
//
//Each has pros and cons. 1. is very simple and can be very 
//efficient if you have some gaurantee that it's impossible to
//overflow your fixed-buffer. The downside is that you could 
//potentially be wasting a lot of memory.
//2. is not that hard to implement, and makes efficient use of
//memory. It adds a performance overhead (and has more moving
//parts, which could introduce bugs). How much overhead? It
//depends on a lot of things and there's no point speculating.
//3. is the most tedious and error-prone to implement. It is
//unlikely that you would get better performance than malloc,
//anyway, and often implements 2. behind the scenes. The only 
//reason to do this would be to make it easier to serialize 
//(and even that is not always true).

//Incidentally, 2. can waste a lot of memory in the worst case.
//usually when you extend the capacity you double it, so the
//waste could actually be worse than 1.

//Same semantics as strlen (doesn't count terminator)
unsigned tqlen(tq const *t);

//Like strdup but for tqs
tq* tqdup(tq const *t);

//Returns position after last-printed item
