The original plan has always been to write the interpreter once, then
rewrite it from scratch. This is for four reasons: 

First, I want to record development videos for anyone who is interested in the
project, but they will be way too long an undirected if I use the first attempt. 
The rewrite development will be shorter and easier to understand.

Second, I knew there would end up being some very ugly code as I was figuring out
how to store all my bookkeeping and the general approach to the functions.

Third, I'm very interested in making this code as library-friendly as possible, 
and using it myself as a library will point out annoying quirks that would be 
worth removing. 

Finally, I can pull out gprof on this prototype and see if there is anything 
worth streamlining 

[ ] Move token type enums, defines, etc. to a separate "defines.h"
[ ] Many headers define different enums for similar things. Try to unify them.
[ ] Find more elegant way to deal with three-char ops (>>= and <<=)
[ ] Deal with variadic functions
[ ] Enforce a consistent style of managing the lookahead in the state
[ ] Change ast.h to use vector.h (if I decide to keep everything in an array like that)
[ ] Add support for structs, unions, enums, and typedefs (obviously)
[ ] Add support for multiple declarations
[ ] Write clear explanation instead of "Very subtle"
[ ] Fill in missing "advance past" comments
[ ] sizeof operator (just a unary op, but argument could be a type decl)
[ ] Right now, to check if the token lookahead is a certain keyword, you need a really 
    long expression. This hurts readability. It should be simpler.
[ ] Decide whether unsigned, short, and long are qualifiers
[ ] Let parsers take in a special token that asks for a list of predictions.
[ ] Initializers in declarations
[ ] Decalarator lists (e.g. int x, *y = NULL, z;)
[ ] lexer_state and parse_state need some way of tracking where we are in the file 
[ ] The most difficult part of any frontend: good error messages and parser recovery
[ ] Add prediction/suggestion support
